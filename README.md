# Wind

The Stream-based Programming Language

## Intro

`Wind` is a fast, portable programming language based on the concept of streams. `Wind` is designed to make it easy to filter, map, reduce, through large amounts of dynamic data. The reactive programming paradigm has become very popular recently, and `Wind`'s goal is to facilitate stream operations and flows in a unique programming language.

`Wind` is also designed to be highly scalable and extendable. The language itself is made up of a stream of binary blocks of data that are called `objects`, and these objects can be expanded and rewritten, allowing for any size of unit of data or values to be used in `Wind`.

## Stage

`Wind` is currently in the alpha development stage, the first build is still in progress.
